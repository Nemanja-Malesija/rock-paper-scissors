# rock-paper-scissors

// Declare the array "choices" containing possible choices for the game. Next, global variables to be used later in functions "playRound" and "game" respectively.

// Function playRound():
Takes in 2 arguments (see function game())
prints out the winner based on conditions and keeps track of the score by incrementing the value of global variables playerScore and computerScore.

// Function game():
Runs a for loop (5 rounds) and inside of it Math random function which will extract a random value from the array "choices".
Next it prompts the user for an input. These two values are stored in already declared global variables computerChoice and playerChoice which will become the arguments for the function playRound.

// Compare the result of 2 scores and print the winner if there is one.
